```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    
    ssl_certificate         /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.full.domain.name/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.full.domain.name/privkey.pem;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.full.domain.name/chain.pem;
    include /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl.conf;
