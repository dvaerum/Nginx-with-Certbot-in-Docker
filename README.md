## Mounting Point
The mountpoint supported by this container

### /etc/nginx/sites-available
All websites you to want to setup should be put in this folder, one file per site.
```
./sites-available:/etc/nginx/sites-available:ro
```
The site template should looks something like this.  
**NOTES:**  
- Don't use `listen 80` because it will break the http2https redirection and HTTP Challenge setup.
- Replace `your.full.domain.name` with your actually domain.
```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    
    ssl_certificate         /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.full.domain.name/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.full.domain.name/privkey.pem;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.full.domain.name/chain.pem;
    include /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl.conf;
    
    # Set your dedicated domain
    server_name your.full.domain.name;
